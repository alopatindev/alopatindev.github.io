I'm still impressed by a talk "Teaching kids real math with computers" that Conrad Wolfram gave at TED Talks in 2010.

Still thinking how the math software can be improved for kids and students (not for computer geeks!) so they could learn math in the better ways.

Right now there's a bunch of commercial software (Matlab, Mathcad, Mathematica, etc.).
Basically created for engineers and scientists, not really for math learning (at least not for kids).

There's also a bunch of free software (Maxima, IPython Notebook, GNU Octave, R, etc.).
These programs are actually very cool, but all of them are having very poor UIs.
For example, UIs for Maxima are simply commands builders.
Very poor builders.
Sometimes they even generate invalid commands.

This is **not what will help** kids to improve their understanding of math.
Useful software should be very, very user-friendly.

Mr. Wolfram shows examples of **interactive programs** developed in Wolfram Mathematica during the talk.

I think **kids primarily need these** kind of programs right now, not the Wolfram Language itself.

The easiest way to achieve that is... probably just to write them in Wolfram Language.

Fortunately, there's a free software alternative to Mathematica called [Mathics](https://mathics.github.io).
This can help with making such programs available for everyone.

The development of such programs is a very challenging problem though.

Curriculum and UI/UX.
These are definitely a huge work.
