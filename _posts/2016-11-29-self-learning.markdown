# **What I've learnt so far**

- **Object-Oriented Programming**
  - unfortunately most people are taught in a dramatically wrong way nowadays (I'm no exception)
  - the right way is actually to focus on [GRASP principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design))
    (this will, at least, help you constructively choose GoF (or whatever) patterns, when you *really* need them)
- **The Scala Programming Language**
  - pros
    - a successful combination of FP + OOP paradigms
    - easier to learn than classical FP languages (e.g. Haskell)
    - relatively large community
    - relatively fast programmer's performance
    - a part of JVM world with its huge well-tried libraries choice
  - cons
    - slow compilation (probably will be fixed after migrating to the new compiler and linker [Dotty](http://dotty.epfl.ch))
    - slow package manager
    - pretty large builds (probably one of the reasons to not use on Android; [Dotty](http://dotty.epfl.ch) will probably fix it as well)
- **The Rust Programming Language**
  - pros
    - a unique set of concepts that encourage people to write safe and performant code
    - fast modern tools that are really made with love (package manager, auto format, linter, ...)
    - documentation generation is handy
  - cons
    - the compiler just doesn't let you write a clean code sometimes
    - struggling with compiler can unexpectedly waste plenty of time
    - weird strings API (`String`, `&str`, `OsString`, ...—lead to weird explicit conversions; [`String::len(&self)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.len) is not a length)
    - you actually can do some [sort of implicit conversions](http://hermanradtke.com/2015/05/06/creating-a-rust-function-that-accepts-string-or-str.html) but this will probably complicate your code anyway
    - [no tail-call optimization](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/217)
    - [no default arguments values](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/6973)
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**
  - after looking for *dozens* of Algorithms video courses it turns out that the clearest courses are made by MIT (specifically, the best professor is [Erik Demaine](http://erikdemaine.org/), in my opinion)
  - there's no such thing as *"the best Algorithms course"* anyway; when something is unclear you can always find an alternative explanation at YouTube
